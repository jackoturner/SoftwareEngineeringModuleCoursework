# TapThat

## Project Overview

Our initiative, TapThat, is a web application centered on community engagement, aimed at supporting and promoting local British pubs, which are experiencing a decline in numbers throughout the UK.

The platform enables users to explore nearby pubs via an interactive map and discover the most efficient walking route to their closest pub utilizing an A star heuristic algorithm.

Users can participate by reviewing pints at various pubs, reading reviews from others, and connecting with the broader community through shared experiences rather than monetary transactions.

Each review submitted will feature an integrated AI component that evaluates the pour and assigns a score, fostering consistent quality and user involvement.

An aggregated leaderboard showcasing the most favored beers assists pubs in understanding community preferences and promotes interaction between patrons and local establishments.

The application embodies the principle of sharing and community building by enhancing awareness of local pubs and motivating individuals to visit, support, and sustain them through collective engagement.
